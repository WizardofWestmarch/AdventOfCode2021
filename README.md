Doing Advent of Code 2021 with F#

Advent of Code is always a great chance to either learn or brush up on a language/tool, and I've been dabbling in f# again after a time away. These are my answers.
Each day will be in a sub file called from Main. I will probably end up commenting out calls to previous days to speed up execution but if you download and run
these you should just need to comment out the lines to run. Also while this is set to .NET 6 I'm using Rider which has not yet updated its parser as of December
1st so I'm still doing things like array.[0] instead of array[0]
